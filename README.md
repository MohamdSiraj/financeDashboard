# Financial Performance Analysis Dashboard (2020-2022)

## Project Overview: Analyzing Financial Performance Trends and Key Metrics

This project addressed the common challenge faced by businesses and individuals alike: understanding and improving financial performance through the analysis of complex financial data. Often, raw financial data is scattered across various sources and difficult to interpret in its original form. The goal of this project was to consolidate this data into a user-friendly dashboard that could reveal key trends, performance indicators, and areas for potential improvement over a three-year period (2020-2022).

The dataset for this project likely comprised detailed financial records, potentially including income statements, expense reports, and savings information. This data could have originated from various sources such as accounting software, spreadsheets, or bank statements. The complexity lies in organizing and analyzing this information to derive meaningful insights into financial health and progress.

## My Approach: How I Built the Dashboard

Using Power BI, I went through the process of building a dashboard step by step to solve this analytical challenge. Hereâ€™s what I did:

* **Data Handling:** I started by loading and preparing the financial data. This involved connecting to the data sources and performing necessary transformations (ETL) to ensure the data was clean, accurate, and structured correctly for effective financial analysis.
* **Creating Visuals:** I designed the dashboard with various charts like dynamic line charts for time trends, bar charts for comparisons, and KPI cards to highlight key metrics at a glance. This visualized the financial data clearly and understandably.
* **Using DAX:** I utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculations for important financial metrics. This included:
    * Calculating month-over-month (MoM) and year-over-year (YoY) growth for income and expenses.
    * Determining savings percentages to track progress towards financial goals.
    * Handling multiple currencies with automatic conversions.
    * Making chart titles and tooltips dynamic for context-sensitive information.
    * Addressing missing data (imputation/handling nulls) for accuracy.
    * Applying formatting techniques for clearer financial data presentation.
* **Making it Interactive:** To allow for deeper exploration, I added interactive elements:
    * **Slicers:** Filters for users to focus on specific time periods or categories.
    * **Bookmarks and Buttons:** For easy navigation between different views/reports and functionalities like data refresh or element visibility toggles.
    * The focus was on a user-friendly experience for financial data exploration.
* **Focusing on What Matters:** The project involved setting up specific calculations to compare current performance with the previous month and analyzing data on both yearly and monthly bases. The goal was to identify significant trends, patterns, and areas of concern or success.

## Key Outcomes and Achievements

The resulting dashboard provides an interactive way to delve into financial data and understand the narrative behind the numbers:

* **Clear View of Financial Trends:** Easily visualize changes in income, expenses, and savings over the three-year period, quickly identifying key performance indicators and the overall financial trajectory.
* **Enhanced Financial Data Exploration:** Interactive filters and slicers enable users to drill down into specific data segments (e.g., a particular year, month, or income/expense category) for detailed analysis.
* **Actionable Financial Insights:** Calculations provide crucial insights like income/expense growth rates and savings percentages, supporting informed financial decision-making.
* **Improved User Experience:** Dynamic titles, tooltips, and intuitive navigation help users effectively understand and explore financial data, even without being financial experts.
